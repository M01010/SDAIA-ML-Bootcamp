Box plot\n","A boxplot is a standardized visual representation that summarizes the distribution of data using five key values: the minimum, the first quartile (Q1), the median, the third quartile (Q3), and the maximum. It provides insights into the presence of outliers and their specific values. Additionally, a boxplot can indicate whether the data is skewed and the extent of the skewness."]},{"cell_type":"code","metadata":{"id":"xh4qQvcQshbT"},"source":["plt.boxplot(                    )\n","plt.ylabel('sepal length (cm)')\n","plt.title('Sepal Length Box plot')"],"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"B9r2x2vNshbV"},"source":["**Sepal length:**\n","1. has no outliers\n","2. negatively skewed: median closest to the max\n","3. not symmetric: whiskers are no equals\n"]},{"cell_type":"code","metadata":{"id":"LnlHTyW3shbW"},"source":["plt.boxplot(                     )\n","plt.ylabel('sepal width (cm)')\n","plt.title('Sepal width Box plot')"],"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"sO3FQXGEshbZ"},"source":["**Sepal width:**\n","1. has outliers\n","2. postively skewed: median closest to the min\n","3. not symmetric: whiskers are no equals"]},{"cell_type":"code","metadata":{"id":"VkUsN_FWshbd"},"source":["plt.boxplot(df['petal length (cm)'])\n","plt.ylabel('petal length (cm)')\n","plt.title('petal Length Box plot')"],"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"lJJhy2iTshbd"},"source":["**Petal length:**\n","1. has no outliers\n","2. negatively skewed: median closest to the max\n","3. not symmetric: whiskers are no equals, distance between median &1Q, median &3Q are not equal"]},{"cell_type":"code","metadata":{"id":"Ai7CM3G8shbe"},"source":["plt.boxplot(df['petal width (cm)'])\n","plt.ylabel('petal width (cm)')\n","plt.title('petal width Box plot')"],"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"3E75MPR9shbe"},"source":["**Petal width:**\n","1. has no outliers\n","2. negatively skewed: median closest to the min\n","3. not symmetric: whiskers are no equals, distance between median &1Q, median &3Q are not equal"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"6rcEsvtqshbv"},"source":["### 4. 1D Histogram plot\n","A frequency distribution displays the frequency or occurrence of each unique value within a dataset.
